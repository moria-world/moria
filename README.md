> There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works. (Alan J. Perlis)

The `moria` programming language is dedicated to exploring simple yet expressive methods, powerful and easy to use.

_**WIP**_ This project is still in the stage of personal development and research, and only accepts the submission of optimization and patches, but any discussion on design and features is welcome.

If you are familiar with any C-like programming language, you can easily understand the syntax rules of `moria`. Of course, `moria` also draws some inspiration from other more modern programming languages to improve readability and programming experience.

## Usage

Unless some actual function is completed, we will not know how it will work.

It is conceivable to install at least through `cargo install moria`.
